In this folder you find five files (besides this text file), specific to the Nexys_A7 board.

The following zip file (posted on the Bb) was created a few years ago for Nexys-4 board.
==
ee354l_divider_timing.zip 
It contains TAâ€™s completed three .bit files (with dot points glowing). 
It also has a top file and .xdc file. 
These 5 files are different for the two boards: the _N4 and the _A7 
The divider_timing_part1.v provided in zip file (being a core design) is good for both the boards
==
If you are using an A7 board, please use this supplemental .zip file 
(ee354l_divider_timing_A7_supplement.zip) in addition to the above zip file.
And use the five _A7 specific file in place of the corresponding N4 files.
