File: Divider_Pico_N4_4bit_A7_supplement.txt

In this folder you find three files, specific to the Nexys_A7 board.

The following zip file (posted on the Bb) was created a few years ago for Nexys-4 board.
==
A completed 4-bit divider design: Divider_Pico_N4_4bit.zip 
It contains TAâ€™s completed  .bit files (with dot points glowing).
==
If you are using an A7 board, please use this supplemental .zip file in addition to the above zip file.
Divider_Pico_N4_4bit_A7_supplement.zip

In this supplemental .zip file, there are three files (with A7_ prefix).
If you are using an A7 board, please remove the A7_ prefix in these 3 file names, 
and move the .bit file to the synthesis subdirectory 
and move the top.v and the .xdc files to the sources subdirectory of the Divider_Pico_N4_4bit directory.

Now you have the Divider_Pico_N4_4bit directory for your Nexys-A7
